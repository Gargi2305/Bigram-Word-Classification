#Bigram Word Classifier

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for word classification using character bigrams and a Decision Tree Classifier. By generating over 1,000 unique bigram features with CountVectorizer and optimizing the model with GridSearchCV, the project achieved over 90% accuracy and 85% precision. The model provides high-quality predictions and demonstrates effective use of bigrams for text classification.
